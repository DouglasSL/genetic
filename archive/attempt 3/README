This thirth attempt, canceled as of 2009/02/02, seemed to be flawed by designed, due to its non-modularity.
It worked quite good, apart from a memory leak somewhere and an untraced segmentation fault due to reading
of invalid memory (which seemed to have gotten overwritten by another routine).

Contents of old README:

New version, written from scratch. Features
* Object oriented;
* Memory efficient, by using STL types and avoiding of raw pointers.


1. DNA Code Description

a) HiÃ«rarchy

Creature -> DNA -> Gen -> Codon

- Creature contains a single DNA string;
- DNA consists out of different genes;
- Every gene contains several codons.

b) Codon Syntax

A codon has 2 members: a list of conditions, and a list of actions.
Conditions as well as actions have two parameters: and identifier, and a vector of parameters.

The following table contains all needed information to construct a DNA string:

STRUCTURAL

CONDITIONS
	- identifiers
		COND_ID_IF		if		2: directional & conditional
		COND_ID_IFN		if not		2: directional & conditional
		COND_ID_WHILE		while		2: directional & conditional
		COND_ID_WHILEN		while not	2: directional & conditional
	- directional parameters
		DIR_UP			up
		DIR_RIGHT		right
		DIR_DOWN		down
		DIR_LEFT		left
	- conditional parameters
		COND_PAR_FREE		is free
		COND_PAR_BLOCK		is blocked


ACTIONS
	- identifiers
		ACT_ID_MOVE		move
	- directional parameters
		DIR_UP			up
		DIR_RIGHT		right
		DIR_DOWN		down
		DIR_LEFT		left
